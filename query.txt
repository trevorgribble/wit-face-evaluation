# Example query.txt for querying processed face data
# All fields are optional. If a field is omitted, it will not be used as a filter.
# If this file is completely empty → the query returns ALL faces in the dataset.

# ============================
# Face Detection Quality Filters
# ============================

# Minimum face detection confidence (from MTCNN stage)
# If not specified, no minimum confidence will be applied.

min_face_conf = 0.99

# Minimum face width in pixels
# If not specified, no minimum width will be applied.

min_face_width = 100

# Minimum face height in pixels
# If not specified, no minimum height will be applied.

#min_face_height = 100

# ============================
# Class-based Filters (ONLY ONE of the two can be used!)
# ============================

# You must choose either `include_classes_AND` or `include_classes_OR`.
# If both are populated, the system will throw an error.
# If both are empty, no include filtering will be applied.

# -------- include_classes_AND --------
# A list of (class_name, confidence_threshold) tuples.
# The face must contain *ALL* of these classes with >= confidence threshold.
# Example:
# include_classes_AND = [('Eyeglasses', 0.5), ('Hat', 0.3)]

include_classes_AND = [('Eyeglasses', 0.6)]

# -------- include_classes_OR --------
# A list of (class_name, confidence_threshold) tuples.
# The face must contain *ANY* of these classes with >= confidence threshold.
# Example:
#include_classes_OR = [('Eyeglasses', 0.6), ('Hat', 0.3)]

#include_classes_OR = [('Eyeglasses', 0.6)]

# ============================
# Exclude Classes with Thresholds
# ============================

# A list of (class_name, confidence_threshold) tuples.
# If a face contains any of these classes with conf >= threshold, it will be excluded.
# Example:
# exclude_classes_AND = [('Sunglasses', 0.2)]


# ============================
# Notes:
# - Only ONE of `include_classes_AND` or `include_classes_OR` should be used.
# - You can safely delete or comment out any of these sections if not needed.
# - You can leave this file completely empty — in that case, all faces will be returned.
# - The system will automatically handle missing parameters.
